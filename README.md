Created a to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating visual aids:

Key Elements:

HTML: Structures the content, defining elements like headings, input fields, lists, and buttons.
CSS: Styles the appearance, controlling colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity, enabling task addition, completion, deletion, and other features.
Basic Structure:

HTML:

Create a heading for the list.
Add an input field for users to type new tasks.
Include a button to submit new tasks.
Create an unordered list (<ul>) to display the tasks.
Within the list, use list items (<li>) to represent individual tasks.
CSS:

Style the list items and input field for visual appeal and clarity.
Consider using visual cues for completed tasks, such as strikethrough or different colors.
JavaScript:

Access the input field and list elements using their IDs.
Implement functions for:
Adding new tasks to the list when the button is clicked.
Marking tasks as completed (e.g., by toggling a checkbox).
Deleting tasks.
Optionally, storing tasks in local storage to persist them across browser sessions.
